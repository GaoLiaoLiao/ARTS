# 1. Algorithm

[49. Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/description/)
```Java

思路：
    1. 方法1：直觉法
        直觉上认为本题应该是采用【15. 3Sum】的方法：即固定一个指针，然后另外两个指针一前一后向中间走
        本题就是【15. 3Sum】的变种，本题可以sort数组，因为本题只返回方法数，而【15. 3Sum】需要返回Index
        其实即便是返回Index，也可以把num做成Pair，每个Pair包含num和Index，
        然后用本题的方法，获得的每一个结果是一个包含3个下标的list，把list里的下标排序即可！
    2. 时间复杂度：O(n^2)
    3. 我刚开始的方法是想统计每个数字出现频率，但是发现那种方法并不好写，并且时间复杂度依然是O(n^2)

class Solution {
    private static final int MOD = (int)1e9 + 7;
    
    public int threeSumMulti(int[] A, int target) {
        int res = 0;
        // 注意！这里sort了数组之后，并不违反i < j < k的题目要求！因为我们要取的是方法数，不是下标！
        Arrays.sort(A);
        
        for(int i = 0; i < A.length - 2; i++) {
            int j = i + 1;
            int k = A.length - 1;
            while(j < k) {
                int sum = A[i] + A[j] + A[k];
                if(sum < target) {
                    j++;
                } else if(sum > target) {
                    k--;
                } else if(A[j] != A[k]) {
                    int left = 1;
                    int right = 1;
                    while(j + 1 < k && A[j] == A[j + 1]) {
                        j++;
                        left++;
                    }
                    while(k - 1 > j && A[k] == A[k - 1]) {
                        k--;
                        right++;
                    }
                    res = (res + left * right) % MOD;
                    j++;
                    k--;
                } else {
                    res = (res + (k - j + 1) * (k - j) / 2) % MOD;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
    

思路：
    1. 方法2：参考Two Sum
        两层for循环，外层for循环代表遍历第三个数字A[k]，内层for循环把A[i],A[j]之和sum全部放入map里！
class Solution {
    // private static final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
    private static final int MOD = (int)1e9 + 7;
    public int threeSumMulti(int[] A, int target) {
        int res = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        for(int i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
            res = (res + map.getOrDefault(target - A[i], 0)) % MOD;
            for(int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                int sum = A[i] + A[j];
                map.put(sum, map.getOrDefault(sum, 0) + 1);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
    

```

# 2. Review
## [Patterns for Resilient Architecture — Part 1](https://medium.com/@adhorn/patterns-for-resilient-architecture-part-1-d3b60cd8d2b6)</br>
Failures are a given, and everything will eventually fail over time. Resilient systems can work in partially failing mode, which isn't suitable for life-critical applications but is viable option for most web applications, such as e-commerce services like Amazon.com, video-on-demand sites such as Netflix, and music service like Soundcloud. However, partial failure might result in lost revenue, but it's probably not life-critical. This is the balance you should aim for: the cost of being highly resilient to failure versus the potential loss of money due to outages. Building resilient architecture includes infrastructure layer, network and data, application design and even people and culture.

### Redundancy
Redundancy is one of the most important things when it comes to building a resilient architecture. Simply put, redundancy is the duplication of components of a system in order to increase the overall availability of that system.
You must have a stateless application and potentially use an elastic load balancer to distribute requests to the application.

### Auto-scaling
Auto-scaling means your application can automatically adjust capacity to demand. A useful auto-scaling technology is creating pre-configured AMIs, also known as `Gold AMIs`, which can accelerate the speed of auto-scaling.

### Infrastructure as Code
One benefit of using infrastructure as code is repeatability. It can reduce the manual configuring and thus reduce configuration differences and configuration drifts. Another benefit it brings about is you always have data backup as you have the infrastructure templates, which is also good for knowledge sharing.

### Immutable Infrastructure
The principle of immutable infrastructure is simple: Immutable components are replaced for every deployment, rather than being updated in place.
  1. No updates should be performed on live systems.</br>
  2. You always start from a new instance of the resource being provisioned, such as EC2 instance, Container, or Lambda Function.</br>
  
<p>
To support application deployment in an immutable infrastructure, you should use canary deployment, which is the technique used to reduce the risk of failure when new versions of application enter production, by gradually rolling out the change to a small subset of users and then slowly rolling it out to the entire infrastructure and making it available to everybody.</br>
The benefit of canary deployment is the near immediate rollback, but more importantly, you get fast and safer deployments with real production test data.
</p>
  
### Stateless application
Stateless applications are prerequisite to auto scaling and immutable infrastructure since any request can be handled by available computing resources. In stateless service, the application must treat all client requests independently of prior requests or sessions, and should never store any information on local disks or memory. A good approach to this problem is sharing state using Memcached, Redis, Cassandra or DynamoDB.

    Duolingo is a free app that helps people who want to learn a new language but can't afford expensive language-learning  software.
    What surprised me most in this article is that Duolingo's pitch to investors was less about creating a free education tool and more about building a sustainable way to generate human translations of the web on a large scale.
    Three lesson learned from Duolingo:
      - Go after a large market -- even larger than your competitor's markets.
      - A/B test everything, and meticulously track and adjust based on your results.
      - Don't be afraid to evolve your business model.
