### 2. Review
[Some study on database storage internals](https://medium.com/@kousiknath/data-structures-database-storage-internals-1f5ed3619d43)<br/>
This article talks about database internal storage. Three kinds of data structure used in databases are fully elaborated.

B Tree
  - Traditional relational databases store data in B tree structyre on disk.
  - Index are maintained in B tree to guarantee faster access to the original data.
  - The rows are stored at the leaf nodes, all intermediate nodes are used to store megadata to navigate CRUD queries.
  - random read/write, in-place replacement, very compact, self balacing.
  - Disk I/O is very costly and dominates the database performance.
  - B tree store data in block fashion as it's efficient for OS to read/write data in blocks instead of individual bytes.
  - From a practical point of view, B-trees, therefore, guarantee an access time of less than 10ms even for extremely large datasets. --Dr. Rudolf Bayer, inventor of the B-tree.
  - read operations is very fast in B tree as the operation has to traverse very few nodes and thus fire fewer disk I/O calls. 
  - Range queries might perform faster when rows to be fetched are found in the same page blocks and the page blocks is already loaded in memory.
  - Two ways to improve the performance of B tree based database:
    - minimise number of indexes
    - sequential insert
  - Write operation is comparatively slow for B tree based database, though workaround like InnoDB buffer can be used.
 
LSM Tree 
  - LSM is the abbreviation of Log Structured Tree.
  - LSM Tree is mainly invented for high write requirements.
  - Unlike B tree, LSM Tree won't modify data, it only append write stream in a sequential manner.
  - LSM maintains one or more in-memory data structure -- AVL tree, red black tree, B tree or skip list where data is written before it moves to disk.
  - When memtable contents exceed a configurable threshold, the memtable data is put in a queue to be flushed to disk.
  - Disk maintains data structure called 'SSTable' or 'Sorted Strings Table', which is the snapshot of data written to a file.
  - SSTable are immutable are LSM systems can maintain multiple such files on disk.
  - LSM systems, like Cassandra, need to scan all the SSTables on disk if the data is not found in memtable, which results in low read speed.
  - Workarounds for the low read speed:
    - A compact process can be used. The compact process essentially applies merge sort on SSTables and write the new sorted data in a new SSTable and delete the old ones.
    - Bloom filters, which are used to get the idea if some data exists in a SSTable in constant time.
  - LSM systems suffer from Read amplification problem -- read more data than it is actually required.
 
Factal Tree Index
  - Factal tree is based on B tree.
  - Factal tree supports message buffers inside all nodes except leaf nodes.
  - When operations, such as add column, delet column, insert and update, are applied, the  operations will be saved as message stored somewhere among the non-leaf nodes. The messages will be cascaded down from where they are stored to leaf nodes when message buffers are full.


### 3. Tip
This week, I was working on a react ticket. I'm not very familiar with react, so learned some basic knowledge of react and redux.</br>

[Why writing objects to disk is called “serialization”: a guide for those too scared to ask](https://tim.mcnamara.nz/post/176906903912/serialization)<br/>
Serialization is a process that transforms data structures into a sequence of bytes. This article explain why serialization is called "serialization" in the following three aspects.
  - live data contains references, serialized data does not
  - human-readable encodings are not machine-friendly
  - programming languages often store more than just the values that they’re representing, but the serialized forms only need the values
