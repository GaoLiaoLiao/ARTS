```Java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> palindromePairs(String[] words) {
        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<>();

                // 否则遇到["abcd","dcba”]这样的输入，会有以下重复输出
                // [[1,0],[0,1],[0,1],[1,0]] (正确的输出应该是[[0,1],[1,0]])

### 2. Review
#### [What Is a Service Mesh?](https://www.nginx.com/blog/what-is-a-service-mesh/)<br/>
This article talks about the definition of sevice mesh and what service mesh does.
  - A service mesh is a configurable infrastructure layer for a microservices application.
    - Service mesh makes communication between service instances flexible, reliable and fast.
    - Service mesh provides service discovery, load balancing, encryption authentication and authorization, support for circuit breaker pattern and other capabilities.
    - Service mesh is usually implemented by providing a proxy instance, called a sidecar, which handles inter-service communications, monitoring, security-realted concerns - anything that can be abstracted away from the services.
    - Istio is currenly the best-known service mesh architecture.
    - Kubernetes is currently the only container orchestration framework supported by Istio.
    
  - Service mesh terminologies:
    - Container orchestration framework
      - Container orchestration framework monitors and manages the set of containers.
      - Kubernetes have cornered this market.
    - Services vs. Service instances
    - Sidecar proxy
      - A sidecar proxy is a proxy instance that's dedicated to a specific service instance.
      - A sidecar proxy communicates with other sidecar proxies and is managed by  orchestration framework.
    - Service discovery
      - The container management framework keeps a list of instances that are ready to receive requests.
    - Load balancing
    - Encryption
    - Authentication and authorization
      - The service mesh can authorize and authenticate requests made from both outside and within the app, sending only validated requests to service instances.
    - Support for the circuit breaker pattern
      - The service mesh can isolate unhealthy instances, then gradually brings them back into the healthy instance pool if warranted.
  - Data Plane
    - The part of service mesh where the work is getting done.
  - Control Plane
    - The part of service mesh that handles tasks such as creating new instances, terminating unhealthy or unneeded instances, monitoring, integrating monitoring and management, implementing application-wide policies and gracefully shutting down the app as a whole.
    - Control plane is typically designed to connect to an API, a command-line interface, and a graphical user interface for managing the app.
    
  - Use case
    - A common use case for service mesh architecture is when you are using containers and microservices to solve very demanding application development problems. For less demanding application needs, simpler architectures are good enough.
    - Service mesh architectures are not the silver bullet. It only solves a specific type of problems.
    - The elements of service mesh architecture - such as NGINX, containers, Kubernetes, and microservices as an architectural approach - can be used in non-service mesh implementation.
