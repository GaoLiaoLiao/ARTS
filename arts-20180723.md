### 1. Algorithm: [880. Random Pick with Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/description/)
   
```Java
思路：
    1. Convert the weight array to a weight sum array, and then generate a random integer between [1, max weight sum].
       Use binary search to find the integer in the weight sum array. The return index is index we want to find.
        [3, 2, 4, 2] -> [3, 5, 9, 11]
        
class Solution {
    int[] nums;
    int max;
    Random rnd;
    public Solution(int[] w) {
        rnd = new Random();
        nums = w;
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            nums[i] += nums[i - 1];
        }
        max = nums[nums.length - 1];
    }
    
    public int pickIndex() {
        int r = rnd.nextInt(max) + 1; // 注意产生的值要是从1开始的！
        int index = Arrays.binarySearch(nums, r);
        if(index < 0) {
            index = -index - 1;
        }
        return index;
    }
}
```

[What happens when you type an URL in the browser and press enter?](https://medium.com/@maneesha.wijesinghe1/what-happens-when-you-type-an-url-in-the-browser-and-press-enter-bb0aa2449c1a)
- Type www.google.com into address bar of your brower

- The browser checks the cache for a DNS record to find the IP address.
  - First, browers check browser cache. The browser maintains a repository of DNS records for a fixed duration for the websites you have visited.
  - Second, the browser checks the OS cache. The browser would make a system call(gethostname on Windows) to fetch the ip records on your OS.
  - Third, The browser will check the router cache.
  - Fourth, it will check ISP cache in your ISP's own DNS server.
  - If all of the cache misses, the ISP's DNS server send a DNS query to find the IP address of the server that hosts www.google.com
    - the `root name server` will redirect the query to `.com domain name server`. 
    - then the `.com domain name server` will redirect the query to `google.com name server`, where the IP of www.google.com can be found and returned.

- Browser initiates a TCP connection with the server.
  - Onced the IP address is received by browser, it will build a connection with the server that macthes the IP address to transfer data.
  - Client sends a SYN packet to the server to see if it is open for new connections.
  - If the server has open ports that can accept and initiate new connections, it will respond with an acknowledge of that SYN using a SYN/ACK packet.
  - The client then will send an ACK packet to the server after receiving the SYN/ACK packet.
  
- The browser sends an HTTP request to the web server.

- The server handles the request and sends back a repsonse.
  - The web server(Apache, IIS) will receive the requests and then pass them to handlers. 
  - The request handlers are the code we write, which will read the request, its' headers and cookies and then generate a response in a particular format(JSON, XML, HTML)
  - The server response contains the web page you requested as well as the status code, compression type(Content-Encoding), cache-control, any cookie to set, privacy information, etc.
  
- The browser display the HTML content.
  - First, the browser will render the bare bone HTML skeleton.
  - Second, it will check the HTML tags and sends out GET requests for addtional elements on the web page, such as images, CSS, javascript files etc.<br/>
    The static files are cached by the browser.
    
- The browser and the server will then communicate through XMLHttpRequest.

### 3. Tip
This week, I decided to learn building web crawler in python. Below is an article regarding how to install ptrhon virtual environment.

```
// install virtualenv
pip3 install virtualenv

// create new clean python virtual environment
virtualenv --no-site-packages venv

// activate the virtual env
source venv/bin/activate

// exit the virtual env
deactivate
```
