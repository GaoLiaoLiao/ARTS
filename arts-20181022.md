## [System Design Interview Concepts – Eventual Consistency](http://www.acodersjourney.com/2018/08/eventual-consistency/)</br>

### What is Eventual Consistency?
CAP theorem dictates that availablilty and strong consistency can't be obtained at the same time, but you can still achieve `eventual consistency`.
The basic scenario is as follows:
  1. Imagine that your website data is replicated on multiple servers across different regions.
  2. Clients from all over the world can access any server to access data(usually being routed to the data center closest to them).
  3. A client writes a piece of data to one of the servers, but it doesn't get copied to the rest of the servers immediately. Instead, the updated server kicks off a bunch of background tasks to update the other servers in the system.
  4. A client accesses the updated server and gets the most recent copy of the data.
  5. However, a different client in another part of the world accesses a different server and gets the old copy. At a later point of time, when all the data propagation tasks started in step 3 has finished, all the clients can get the most updated copy of the data. Now the system has `eventually` become `consistent`.
According to Wikipedia:
  - Eventual consistency is a consistency model used in distributed computing to achieve high availability that informally guarantees that, if no new updates are made to a given data item, eventually all accesses to that item will return the last updated value.

### Immediate Consistency vs Eventual Consistency
The opposite of eventual consistency is immediate(or strict or strong) consistency. 
  - Strict consistency states that for any incoming write operation, once a write is acknowledged to the client, the updated value is visible on read from any replicated server in the system. This effectively means that all readers are blocked until replication of the new data to all the servers are complete.
  - Eventual consistency means that all nodes are always available to be read but some nodes may have stale data at a particular point of time.

### Why not use Immediate Consistency all the time?
Although immediate consistency guarantees that clients always see the updated data, it has two major problems:
  1. Having strict consistency guarantee can have detrimental effect on system availability and performance, depending on the scenario.
  2. Some scenarios may not require strict consistency, so there is no need to use immediate consistency for these cases.
  
### Eventual Consistency Models in Real Systems
Here we discuss four real life examples of systems where eventual consistency is a good fit.
  1. Example 1: Photo sharing system like Flicker
     When a user upload a new photo, it might get updated to node A. Another user querying node B for photos won't see the new photo until node A finishes propgating the new photo to node B. However, the new photo does eventually propagate to node B and user B will eventually be able to see it.
  2. Example 2: Message timeline for a social app like Facebook or Twitter
     When you post a status message on Facebook, or tweet a message via twitter, it might not be immediately visible to your friends or followers. But they'll be able to see the status updates/tweets eventually.
  3. Example 3: DNS
     The most popular system that implements eventual consistency is the DNS. DNS servers do not necessarily reflect the latest values. It takes a certain amount of time to propagate new changes to all the DNS servers and clients.
  4. Example: Adding items to a shopping cart
     Suppose you're shopping online and the datacenter fails right after you added an item to the cart. In this case, the datacenter fails over to another replica where the event of adding the item to the your cart hasn't been propagated. But it's actually acceptable for you to add the item again again. So in this case eventual consistency will be sufficient.

### Support for Eventual Consistency in Modern Databases
Most commercial NoSQL databases, such as Azure cosmos DB and Cassandra, offer different consistency levels including but not limited to eventual consistency and strict consistency.

### Key Takeaways
Here are some important things you need to remember for system design interview:
  1. Difference between strict consistency and eventual consistency
  2. NoSQL databases supports a wide spectrum consistency models. 
  3. Understand the scenarios where eventual consistency will be useful and design systems as such.
Finally, a key thing to keep in mind is that a distributed system might have some parts which use eventual consistency and some parts which use strict consistency. For example, `up-vote` on a forum might use eventual consistency whereas `password updates` for users in the same system might use strict consistency.
