# 2. Review
## JVM Architecture
The JVM is divided into three main subsystems:
  1. ClassLoader System
  2. Runtime Data Area
  3. Execution Engine

### ClassLoader System
Java dynamically loads classes by using the ClassLoader subsystem. It loads, links and initializes the class file when it refers to a class for the first time at runtime. 
Class loading includes three steps:
  1. Loading
  2. Linking
  3. Initialization

#### Loading
There are three ClassLoaders help load classes:
  1. Bootstrap ClassLoader
  2. Extension ClassLoader
  3. Application ClassLoader
  
#### Linking
There are three steps for linking:
  1. Verify
  2. Prepare
  3. Resolve

#### Initialization
Initialization is the final phase of class loading. In this phase:
  1. Static variables will be assigned with the original values.
  2. Static blocks will be executed.
  
### Runtime Data Area
The `Runtime Data Area` is composed of 5 major parts:
  1. Method Area
  2. Heap Area
  3. Stack Area
  4. PC Registers
  5. Native Method Stacks
  
### Execution Engine
In the Java virtual machine specification, the behavior of the execution engine is defined in terms of an instruction set. For each instruction, the specification describes in detail what an implementation should do when it encounters the instruction as it executes bytecode, but says very little about how.
The `Execution Engine` executes the `.class file`s. It reads the bytecode in the .class files line by line, uses data and information present in various memory area and executes instructions.
The Execution Engine contains three parts:
  1. Interpreter
  2. JIT Compiler
  3. Garbage Collector

#### Interpreter
It interprets the bytecode line by line and then executes. The disadvantage is that when one method is called multiple times, every time interpretation is required.

#### JIT(Just in Time) Compiler
The JIT Compiler compiles bytecode and changes it to machine code at runtime. 
JIT provides direct `native code` so that re-interpretation is not required, thus efficiency is improved.

#### Garbage Collector
Garbage Collector collects and removes unreferenced objects.

#### JNI(Java Native Interface)
`JNI(Java Native Interface)` is an interface which interacts with the `Native Method Libraries` that provides the native libraries(C/C++) required by the `Execution Engine`. It enables the JVM to call C/C++ libraries and to be called by C/C++ libraries which may be specific to hardware.

#### Native Method Libraries
`Native Method Libraries` is a collection of native libraries written in C/C++, which are required by `Execution Engine`.

# 3. Tip
本周看了Head First Design Pattern的书，学习了以下的设计模式：
  1. [Strategy Pattern](https://github.com/GaoLiaoLiao/Java-Design-Pattern/tree/master/designpattern/src/strategypattern)
  1. Observer Pattern

<!--
1. 使用IntelliJ，在pom文件中，右键 Diagrams -> Show Dependencies 可以生成依赖类图。
2. 使用Spring Boot + MySQL实现基本的CRUD功能。
