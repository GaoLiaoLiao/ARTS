# 1. Algorithm

[49. Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/description/)
```Python
思路：
    1. sort一个string，得到这个string对应的lexigraphcal最小的anagram
        # sorted(string)得到一个list
        key = "".join(sorted(string))
    2. 得到一个dict的所有key value pair，使用dict.items()，得到一个dict view对象
        for k, v in dict.items():
            res.append(v)
    3. 可以用setdefault(key, default_value)函数来替代下面的代码段
            # if key not in dict:
            #     dict[key] = []
            # dict[key].append(s)
            # 可以用下面一行代替
            dict.setdefault(''.join(sorted(s)), []).append(s)
    4. collections.defaultdict(list)产生一个defaultdict，可以指定value类型，这样遇到之前不存在的key就可以直接用了！
            # 不需要判断key是否存在，直接可以用
            anagrams = collections.defaultdict(list)
            anagrams[key].append(string)
    5. tuple是不可以变的，因此可以用tuple当做dict的key
            dict.setdefault(tuple(sorted(s)), []).append(s)

class Solution:
    # # 方法1：dict
    # def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
    #     """
    #     :type strs: List[str]
    #     :rtype: List[List[str]]
    #     """
    #     dict = {}
    #     for s in strs:
    #         key = "".join(sorted(s))
    #         if key not in dict:
    #             dict[key] = []
    #         dict[key].append(s)
    #     # for k, v in dict.items():
    #     #     res.append(v)
    #     # 可以换成下面这句
    #     return list(dict.values())
    
    # 方法2：dict.setdefault("".join(sorted(s)), []).append(s)  
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
        dict = {}
        for s in strs:
            dict.setdefault(''.join(sorted(s)), []).append(s)
        return list(dict.values())
    
    # # 方法3：用tuple作为dict的key，tuple(sorted(s))
    # def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
    #     dict = {}
    #     for s in strs:
    #         dict.setdefault(tuple(sorted(s)), []).append(s)
    #     return list(dict.values())
    
        
    # # 方法4：collections.defaultdict(list)
    # def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
    #     """
    #     :type strs: List[str]
    #     :rtype: List[List[str]]
    #     """
    #     anagrams = collections.defaultdict(list)
    #     for string in strs:
    #         key = ''.join(sorted(string))
    #         anagrams[key].append(string)
    #     return list(anagrams.values())

# 2. Review
## [Patterns for Resilient Architecture — Part 1](https://medium.com/@adhorn/patterns-for-resilient-architecture-part-1-d3b60cd8d2b6)</br>
Failures are a given, and everything will eventually fail over time. Resilient systems can work in partially failing mode, which isn't suitable for life-critical applications but is viable option for most web applications, such as e-commerce services like Amazon.com, video-on-demand sites such as Netflix, and music service like Soundcloud. However, partial failure might result in lost revenue, but it's probably not life-critical. This is the balance you should aim for: the cost of being highly resilient to failure versus the potential loss of money due to outages. Building resilient architecture includes infrastructure layer, network and data, application design and even people and culture.

### Redundancy
Redundancy is one of the most important things when it comes to building a resilient architecture. Simply put, redundancy is the duplication of components of a system in order to increase the overall availability of that system.
You must have a stateless application and potentially use an elastic load balancer to distribute requests to the application.

### Auto-scaling
Auto-scaling means your application can automatically adjust capacity to demand. A useful auto-scaling technology is creating pre-configured AMIs, also known as `Gold AMIs`, which can accelerate the speed of auto-scaling.

### Infrastructure as Code
One benefit of using infrastructure as code is repeatability. It can reduce the manual configuring and thus reduce configuration differences and configuration drifts. Another benefit it brings about is you always have data backup as you have the infrastructure templates, which is also good for knowledge sharing.

### Immutable Infrastructure
The principle of immutable infrastructure is simple: Immutable components are replaced for every deployment, rather than being updated in place.
  - No updates should be performed on live systems.
  - You always start from a new instance of the resource being provisioned, such as EC2 instance, Container, or Lambda Function.</br>
To support application deployment in an immutable infrastructure, you should use canary deployment, which is the technique used to reduce the risk of failure when new versions of application enter production, by gradually rolling out the change to a small subset of users and then slowly rolling it out to the entire infrastructure and making it available to everybody.</br>
The benefit of canary deployment is the near immediate rollback, but more importantly, you get fast and safer deployments with real production test data.
  
### Stateless application
Stateless applications are prerequisite to auto scaling and immutable infrastructure since any request can be handled by available computing resources. In stateless service, the application must treat all client requests independently of prior requests or sessions, and should never store any information on local disks or memory. A good approach to this problem is sharing state using Memcached, Redis, Cassandra or DynamoDB.
