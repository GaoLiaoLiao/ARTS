[1021. Best Sightseeing Pair](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-sightseeing-pair/description/)
```Java        
思路：
    1. 遍历数组A，每次遍历一个数字A[i]，下标在[0, i - 1]之间的数字的值就都减1。每次做完减1操作后，我们只需要找到下标在[0, i - 1]中的最大值即可。
        这个最大值加上A[i]即是潜在的最大score。
        比如遍历到A[3]，那么我们应该从是A[0] - 3, A[1] - 2, A[2] - 1中选出最大值，这样可以得到的pair value就是最大值。

class Solution {
    public int maxScoreSightseeingPair(int[] A) {
        int res = 0;
        int cur = 0;
        for(int num : A) {
            res = Math.max(res, cur + num);
            cur = Math.max(cur, num) - 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}

The author introduced a UDB(Understand, Design, Build) pattern to solve problems that do not have obvious solution, which he finds it very useful in his fast-growing engineering team.
The author thinks that we need to first understand some basic things like the business outcome we want, the difficulties that prevent us from achieving the outcome, and available code or infrastructure that might be helpful.
The second step is designing. The author believes that the first solution we could think of might not be the best solution. We should think some more possible approaches and compare their benefits, risks and mitigations.
The last step is building. After finishing the first step and the second step, we can do well in the last step - coding.
