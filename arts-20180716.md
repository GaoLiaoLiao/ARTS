### 1. Alogrithom: [158. Read N Characters Given Read4 II - Call multiple times](https://leetcode.com/problems/read-n-characters-given-read4-ii-call-multiple-times/description/)

```Java
思路：
    1. 注意是从一个文件里读char，先读到cache里，然后从cache里读到buf里！
    2. 用cache模仿一个buffer
        用left，right两个指针表示cache最大长度
        每次都先把cache里上次读完剩余的char放入buf中！然后再往cache里读入文件里新的char
    3. 注意cache的最大长度可能不是4
        因为如果文件里剩下3个char，那么读到cache里也只有3个！

/* The read4 API is defined in the parent class Reader4.
      int read4(char[] buf); */

public class Solution extends Reader4 {
    /**
     * @param buf Destination buffer
     * @param n   Maximum number of characters to read
     * @return    The number of characters read
     */
    char[] cache = new char[4];
    int left = 0;
    int right = 0;
    public int read(char[] buf, int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while(count < n) {
            if(left == right) {
                right = read4(cache);
                left = 0;
            }
            
            if(left == right) {
                break;
            }
            while(count < n && left < right) {
                buf[count++] = cache[left++];
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

[Top REST API Best Practices](https://code-maze.com/top-rest-api-best-practices/)
- REST 
  - REST is short for Representational State Transfer
  - A way to communicate between computer systems on the World Wide Web.
  - Compatible but not bound specifically to with HTTP.
  - HATEOAS, the Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State, proposes the client and server using typermedia.
- Restful
  - Client-server architecture
  - Stateless: the server should not save any states between different requests. 
               However, the state of the session is exclusively left to the responsibility of the client.
               Each request should contains all needed information for a connector to understand the request, 
               and should not be dependent on preceding requests.
  - Cacheable
- Concrete or Abstract APIs?
  - use concrete words like /owners and /blogposts instead of /entities or /blogs.
  
- Use Nouns in URL
  - Bad URLs: use verb directly in URL
    /getAllBlogPosts
    /updateBlogPost/12
    /deleteBlogPost/12
    /updateAuthor/3
  - Good URLs: use HTTP method as a verb
    GET /authors/3/blogposts 
    POST /blogposts
    DELETE /blogposts/12

- Error Handling
  - A good way is to return Status Code and error message when error happens.
  - Never leave the user unaware of what's going on. 
  
- Security
  - REST doesn't deal with security, the HTTP authentication does.
  - Request should be sent over HTTPS
  
- REST API Versioning
  - Version api by prefixing the endpoints, like /v1/blogposts/42
- Documentation
  - Documentation is important

### 3. Tip
This week, I learned all kinds of JOINs, such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN, SELF JOIN
FULL JOIN
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;

SELF JOIN - Match customers that are from the same city
SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City
FROM Customers A, Customers B
WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
AND A.City = B.City 
ORDER BY A.City;

[Under the hood: Broadcasting live video to millions](https://code.fb.com/ios/under-the-hood-broadcasting-live-video-to-millions/)
This article talks about how Facebook Mentions deal with "Thundering Herd" problem. 
The basic idea is just using multiple layers of cache servers and sending only one request while holding the other same requests in request queues when cache misses.
