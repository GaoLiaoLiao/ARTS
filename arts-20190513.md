# 2. Review
This week, I started to read High Performance MySQL, Third Edition. Below are the notes that I extracted from Chapter 1.

MySQL's most important feature is its storage-engine architecture, whose design separates query processing and other server tasks from data storage and retrieval.

## MySQL's Logical Architecture
There are three layers in MySQL's logical architecture:
  1. connection handling, authentication, security, and so forth.
  2. code for query parsing, analysis, optimization, caching, and all the built-in functions. Any functionality provided across storage-engines lives at this level, such as stored procedures, triggers, views.
  3. storage engines is responsible for  storing and retrieving all data stored "in" MySQL. It provides `storage engine API` for MySQL server.
  
### Connection Management and Security
Each client connection gets it own thread within the server process. The connection's queries execute within that single thread, which in turn resides on one core or CPU.

### Optimization and Execution
MySQL parses queries to create internal structure called the parse tree, and then applies a variety of optimizations.

## Concurrency Control
Anytime more than one query needs to change data at the same time, the problem of concurrency control arises. MySQL has to do deal with it at two levels: 
  1. the server level
  2. the storage engine level.

### Read/Write Locks
The solution to concurrency control is a locking system, which contains two types of locks: 
  1. Shared locks/read locks
  2. Exclusive locks/write locks

### Lock Granularity
There are two kinds of locks:
  1. Table locks
  2. Row locks, which is available in the innoDB and XtraDB storage engines.
  
## Transaction
A transaction can either succeed or fail. A transaction begins with a `START TRANSACTION` and ends with a `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`. </br>
Transactions alone are NOT enough unless the system passes the `ACID` test. </br>
ACID transactions ensure that banks don't lose your money. </br>
  1. Atomicity
  2. Consistency
  3. Isolation
  4. Durability

### Isolation Levels
The SQL standard defines four isolation levels, with specific rules for which changes are and aren't visible inside and outside a transaction.
  1. READ UNCOMMITTED
  2. READ COMMITTED
  3. REPEATABLE READ
  4. SERIALIZABLE

| Isolation level  | Dirty reads possible | Non-repeatable reads possible | Phantom reads possible | Locking reads |
|------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| READ UNCOMMITTED | Yes                  | Yes                           | Yes                    | No            |
| READ COMMITTED   | No                   | Yes                           | Yes                    | No            |
| REPEATABLE READ  | No                   | No                            | Yes                    | No            |
| SERIALIZABLE     | No                   | No                            | No                     | Yes           |
  
### Deadlocks
The more sophisticated systems, such as InnoDB storage engine, will notice circular dependencies and return an error instantly.
Deadlocks can be caused by two reasons:
  1. true data conflicts
  2. how a storage engine works

### Transaction Logging
Most storage engines use `write-ahead logging`:
  1. The storage engine changes its in-memory copy of data, which is fast.
  2. The storage engine then write a record of the change to the transaction log, which is on disk and therefore durable, which is also fast. </br>
     Appending logs is fast as it involves sequential I/O in one small area of the disk instead of random I/O in many places.
  3. Then, at some later time, a process can update the table on disk.
  

## Multiversion Concurrency Control - MVCC
MVCC is a twist on row-level locking. It avoids the need for locking at all in many cases and can have much lower overhead. </br>
Depending on how it is implemented, it can allow nonblocking reads, while locking only the necessary rows during write operations. </br>
MVCC works only with the `REPEATBLE READ` and `READ COMMITTED` isolation levels.


## MySQL's Storage Engines
You should use InnoDB for your tables unless you have a compelling need to use a different engine. </br>
Below are some features of InnoDB:
  1. InnoDB is the default transactional storage engine for MySQL and the most important and broadly useful engine overall.
  1. InnoDB is designed for processing many short-lived transactions that usually complete rather than being rolled back.
  1. InnoDB's automatic crash recovery make it popular for non-transactional storage needs, too.
  1. InnoDB uses MVCC to achieve high concurrency.
  1. InnoDB implements all four SQL standard isolation levels.
  1. InnoDB defaults to the `REPEATABLE READ` isolation level, and is has a `next-key locking` strategy to prevents `phantom reads` in this isolation level.
  1. InnoDB tables are built on a clustered index, and thus provides very fast primary key lookups.
  1. InnoDB supports truly "hot" online backups through a variety of mechanisms.
