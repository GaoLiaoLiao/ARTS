[992. Subarrays with K Different Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarrays-with-k-different-integers/description/)
```Java
思路：
【992. Subarrays with K Different Integers】
    1. 本题是Sliding window类型的题目
        atMostK函数返回的是最多包含K个unique元素的subarray个数。
        用atMostK(A, K) - atMostK(A, K - 1)即可求出subarraysWithExactKDistinct
    2. j - i + 1，求的是以当前元素A[i]为最后一个元素且至多包含K个元素的subarray个数。
class Solution {
    public int subarraysWithKDistinct(int[] A, int K) {
        return atMostK(A, K) - atMostK(A, K - 1);
    }
    
    private int atMostK(int[] A, int K) {
        int res = 0;
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        while(right < A.length) {
            map.put(A[right], map.getOrDefault(A[right], 0) + 1);
            if(map.get(A[right]) == 1) {
                K--;
            }
            
            while(K < 0) {
                map.put(A[left], map.get(A[left]) - 1);
                if(map.get(A[left]) == 0) {
                    K++;
                }
                left++;
            }
            res += right - left + 1;
            right++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}

## [What is Netty?](http://ayedo.github.io/netty/2013/06/19/what-is-netty.html)
This article talks about what Netty is and explains some basic design philosophy Netty employed.

1. Netty is a networking library for Java: It was designed to support developers who wish to create applications such as web servers, chat servers, message brokers or whatever networking application you might come up with yourself.

2. Netty helps developers to deal with lower level networking I/O. Netty helps developers write and maintain asynchronous code.

3. With Netty, we could do I/O using a single thread or a small number of threads instead of creating a thread for each request, as threads are quite expensive in terms of memory consumption and context switch and multi-threaded programming is complicated.

4. Netty provides developers a unified asynchronous API abstraction over the native Java I/O frameworks, which means we can write applications against Netty API and specify which underlying native API we want to use. </br>
  Netty uses `selector` to pick available events for threads, developers only need to write the business code to deal with these events.

5. Netty uses `Reactor` pattern. If you would like react to an event, you can just subscribe a method to it. Once the event occurs, the dispatcher then calls the subscribed calls one by one. This pattern is commonly known as `the event loop` or `event dispatcher`. </br>
  Netty allows developers to attach a whole sequence of handlers to an event, which can pass their output as input to the next handler.

### [TCP/IP Ports and Sockets Explained](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/tcpip-ports-sockets/)
1. IP address identifies a device.</br>
  IP address + port number identifies application or service running on the computer.
  
2. A socket = IP address + port number

3. A connection between two computers uses sockets; Each end of the connection will have a socket.</br>
  Client port numbers are dynamically assigned and can be reused once the session is closed.
  
4. Port number ranges </br>
  0 - 1023: well known ports. Web servers normally use port 80 and SMTP server use port 25. </br>
  1024 - 49151: Registered Port. These can be registered for services with the IANA and should be treated as semi-reserved. User written programs should not use these ports. </br>
  49152 - 65535: Ephemeral ports. These ports can be used by client programs. When a web browser connects to a web server, the browser will allocate itself a port in this range. </br>

## [How do you finish big side projects?](https://eccentric-j.com/blog/4-completing-side-projects-in-2019.html)
Many developers have their own side projects. Some developers create their own side projects for fun. Others work on their own side projects trying to earn more money. A big issue with all these projects is that a lot of side projects are not finished as expected. This articles talks about how to finish big side projects.
