## [Please stop calling databases CP or AP](http://martin.kleppmann.com/2015/05/11/please-stop-calling-databases-cp-or-ap.html)</br>
 This article talks about the CAP theorem. It is written by the author of `Designing Data-Intensive Applications` and posted on his blog. It gives a very narrow and precise definition of `Consistency`, `Availability` and `Partition Tolerance`, and clarifies some common misunderstandings of CAP theorem with examples.

### Consistency
Consistency in CAP actually means `linearizability`, which is a very specific(and very strong) notion of consistency. In particular it has got nothing to do with the C in ACID, even though that C also stands for "consistency".

All nodes see the same data at the same time. No stale or old values should be retrieved by any user at any time. Consistency is achieved by updating several nodes before allowing further reads.

### Availability
Availability in CAP is defined as "every request received by a non-failing [database] node in the system must result in a [non-error] response". It's not 
sufficient for some node to be able to handle the request: any non-failing node needs to be able to handle it. Many so-called "highly available"(i.e. low downtime) systems actually do not meet this definition of availability.

However, Availability in practice does not quite correspond to CAP-availability. Your application's availability is probably measured with some SLA(e.g. 99.9% of well-formed requests must return a successful response within 1 second), but sunch an SLA can be met both with CAP-available and CAP-unavailable system.

### Partition Tolerance 
Partition Tolerance basically means that you're communicating over an asynchronous network that may delay or drop messages. The interent and all our datacenters have this property, so you don't really have any choice in this matter.

System continues to work despite message loss or partial failure. A partition-tolerant system can sustain any amount of network failure that doesn't result in a failure of the entire network. Data is sufficiently replicated across combinations of nodes and networks to keep the system up through intermittent outages.

### CAP-Availability
Here's an example to explain the need to give up either linearizability or availability.
Suppose there are two datacenters: datacenter A and datacenter B. The exact method of replication doesn't matter and the requiredment of replication is that whenever data is written in one datacenter, it has to be written to the replica in the other datacenter. Assuming that clients can only connect to one datacenter, there must be a network link between the two datacenters over which the replication happens.</br>

Now assume the network link is interrupted and you can only choose one of the following two options:</br>
  1. Choose Availability: The application continues to be allowed to write to the database, so it remains fully available in both datacenters. However, any changes that are written in one datacenter will not appear in the other datacenter. This violates linearizability.
  2. Choose Consistency(Linearizability): If you don't want to lose linearizability, you have to make sure you do all your reads and writes in one datacenter, which you may call the leader. In the other datacenter, the database must stop accepting reads and writes until the network partition is healed and the database is in sync again. Thus, although the non-leader database has not failed, it cannot process requests, so it is not CAP-available.

Note that in our notionally "unavailable" situation in option 2, we are still happily processing requests in one of the datacenters. So if a system chooses linearizability(i.e. it is not CAP-available), that doesn't necessarily mean that a network partition automatically leads to an outage of the application. If you can shift all clients to using the leader datacenter, the clients will in fact see no downtime at all!



### CP/AP: A False Dichotomy
Actually we are not able to classify even one datastore as unambiguously `AP` or `CP`. Below are some reasons why we should stop putting datastores into the "AP" or "CP" buckets.
  1. Within one piece of software, you may have various operations with different consistency characteristics.
  2. Many systems are neither consistent nor available under the CAP's theorem's definition.
  3. Even though most software doesn't neatly fit one of those two buckets, people try to shoehornn software into one of the two buckets.
  4. A huge amount of subtlety is lost by putting a system into one of the two buckets.
  5. Even Eric Brewer amits that CAP is misleading and oversimplified. In 2000, CAP theorem was introduced to start a discussion about trade-offs in distributed data systems, and it did that very well. It wasn't intended to be a breakthrough formal result, nor was it meant to be a rigorous classification scheme for data systems. Now we have a much greater range of tools with different consistency and fault tolerance models to choose from.
  `CAP has served its purpose, and now it's time to move on`.
  
### CAP Theorem Clarification
  - The CAP system model is a single, read-write register -- that's all. The CAP theorem has nothing to do with transactions that touch multiple objects: they are out of scope of the theorem, unless you can somehow reduce them down to a single register.
  
  - The only fault considered by CAP theorem is a network partition(i.e. nodes remain up, but the network between some of them is not working). There can be some other kinds of fault: nodes can crash or be rebooted, you can run out of disk space, you can hit a bug in the software, etc. But that's out of scope of the CAP theorem.
  
  - Also, the CAP theorem says nothing about latency, which people tend to care about more than availability. In fact, CAP-available systems are allowed to be arbitrarily slow to respond, and can still be called "available". But common users wouldn't call your system "available" if it takes 2 minutes to load a page.
  
  - If your use of words matches the precise definition of the proof, then the CAP theorem applies to you. But if you'are using some other notion of consistency and availability, you can't expect the CAP theorem to still apply, and thus you can't turn to the CAP theorem for guidance and use the CAP theorem to justify your point of view.
  
  - If your application requires linearizability, and some replicas are disconnected from the other replicas due to a network problem, then some replicas cannot process requests while they are disconnected: they must either wait until the network problem is fixed, or return an error(either way, they become unavailable).

  - If your application does not require linearizability, then it can be written in a way that each replica can process requests independently, even if it is disconnected from other replicas(e.g., muliti-leader). In this case, the application can remain available in the face of a network problem, but its behavior is not linearizable.
