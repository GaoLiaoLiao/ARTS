### 1. Algorithm: [827. Making A Large Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/making-a-large-island/description/)
```Java
思路：
827. Making A Large Island
    1. 给每个岛一个编号！用Map<Integer, Integer> 记下来每个岛的area
        唯一一点需要注意的！在grid[i][j] == 0的时候，要用set来判断四周的岛是否访问过！

class Solution {
    
    private static final int[][] dirs = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};
    
    public int largestIsland(int[][] grid) {
        if(grid == null || grid.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int res = 0;
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int id = 2;
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        // calculate all island areas
        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if(grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    int tmp = dfs(grid, i, j, id);
                    map.put(id, tmp);
                    res = Math.max(res, tmp);
                    id++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if(grid[i][j] == 0) {
                    int tmp = 1;
                    Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
                    for(int[] dir : dirs) {
                        int x = i + dir[0];
                        int y = j + dir[1];
                        if(x < 0 || x >= m || y < 0 || y >= n || grid[x][y] == 0) {
                            continue;
                        }
                        // 注意这句一定要加上！
                        if(!set.add(grid[x][y])) {
                            continue;
                        }
                        
                        tmp += map.get(grid[x][y]);
                    }
                    res = Math.max(res, tmp);
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    public int dfs(int[][] grid, int x, int y, int id) {
        
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int area = 1;
        grid[x][y] = id;
        
        for(int[] dir : dirs) {
            int nextX = x + dir[0];
            int nextY = y + dir[1];
            if(nextX < 0 || nextX >= m || nextY < 0 || nextY >= n || grid[nextX][nextY] != 1) {
                continue;
            }   
            area += dfs(grid, nextX, nextY, id);
        }
        return area;
    }
}

### 2. Review
#### [Introduction to Database Concurrency Control](www.agiledata.org/essays/concurrencyControl.html#OptimisticLocking)</br>
##### Introduction to collisions
A collision is said to occur when two activities, which may or may not be full-fledged transactions, attempt to change entities within a system of record. There are three fundamental ways that two activities can interfere with one another:</br>
  1. Dirty read<br/>
        Activity 1 (A1) reads an entity from the system of record and then updates the system of record but does not commit the change (for example, the change hasn’t been finalized). Activity 2 (A2) reads the entity, unknowingly making a copy of the uncommitted version. A1 rolls back (aborts) the changes, restoring the entity to the original state that A1 found it in. A2 now has a version of the entity that was never committed and therefore is not considered to have actually existed.
  2. Non-repeatable read<br/>
        A1 reads an entity from the system of record, making a copy of it. A2 deletes the entity from the system of record. A1 now has a copy of an entity that does not officially exist.
  3. Phantom read<br/>
        A1 retrieves a collection of entities from the system of record, making copies of them, based on some sort of search criteria such as “all customers with first name Bill.”A2 then creates new entities, which would have met the search criteria (for example, inserts “Bill Klassen” into the database), saving them to the system of record. If A1 reapplies the search criteria it gets a different result set.
##### Locking strategies
There are three ways to resolve collisions:
  - Pessimistic locking</br>
    - Pessimistic locking avoids collisions but reduces system performance.</br>
    - Pessimistic locking is an approach where an entity is locked in the database for the entire time that it is in application memory(often in the form of an object).</br>
    - A write lock prevents anyone from reading, updating, or deleting the entity.</br>
    - A read lock allows others to read the entity but not update or delete it.</br>
    - The scope of a lock might be the entire database, a table, a collection of rows, or a single row. These locks are called database locks, table locks, page locks, and row locks respectively.</br>
    - The advantages of pessimistic locking are that it is easy to implement and guarantees that your changes to the database are made consistently and safely.</br>
    - The primary disadvantage is that this approach is not scalable. When a system has many users, or when the transactions involve a greater number of entities, or when transactions are long lived, then the chance of having to wait for a lock to be released increases.</br>
    
  - Optimistic locking</br>
    - Optimistic locking detects collisions and then resolve them.</br>
    - Optimistic locking is viable for situation where collisions are infrequent.</br>
    - An example can be found [here](http://www.agiledata.org/essays/concurrencyControl.html#Figure1OptimisticLocking).</br>
    - There are two ways to detect a collision.</br>
      - Mark the source with a unique identifier.</br>
        - The source data row is marked with a unique value each time it is updated. At the point of update, the mark is checked, and if there is a different value than what you originally read in, then you know that there has been an update to the source.</br>
      - Retain a copy of the original.</br>
        - The source data is retrieved at the point of updating and compared with the values that were originally retrieved. If the values have changed, then a collision has occurred. This is the only option if you are unable to add sufficient columns to your databases schema to maintain the concurrency marks.</br>
    
  - "Overly optimistic" locking</br>
    - Overly optimistic completely ignores the issue.</br>
    - This stragegy is appropriate for single user systems, systems where the system of record is guarantted to be accessed by only one user or system process at a time, or read-only tables.</br>
##### Collision resolution strategies
Five basic strategies to resolve collisions:</br>
  1. Give up.</br>
  2. Display the problem and let the user decide.</br>
  3. Merge the changes.</br> 
  4. Log the problem so someone can decide later.</br> 
  5. Ignore the collision and overwrite.</br> 
    
##### Choosing a locking strategy

| Live-High Volume  	                 | Account  	        | Optimistic (first choice)         |
|   	                                 |   	                | Pessimistic (second choice)       |
| Live-Low Volume  	                     | Customer         	| Pessimistic (first choice)   	    |
|     	                                 | Insurance Policy  	| Optimistic (second choice)        |
| Log (typically append only)  	         | AccessLog   	        | Overly Optimistic   	            |
|                                        | AccountHistory   	|   	                            |

| Lookup/Reference (typically read only) | State  	            | Overly Optimistic  	            |
|                                        | PaymentType  	    |                                 	|   	


      
      
### 3. Tip
This week, I reviewed the knowledge of probability theory that I first learnt in my undergradudate school, inorder to start to learn machine learning.
I mainly followed this video tutorial:[https://www.bilibili.com/video/av22660033/?p=2](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av22660033/?p=2).
