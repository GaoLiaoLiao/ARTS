## [How to do distributed locking](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html)
This article talks about the potential issues with the Redlock algorithm, which claims to implement fault-tolerant distributed locks on top of Redis.
The author thinks Redis is a good tool and he has successfully used it in production. However, Redis has been gradually misused in areas of data management where there are stronger consistency and durability expectations.

### What are you using that lock for?
When using lock, we use it either for `Efficiency` or `Correctness`. `Efficiency` saves you from doing duplicate operations, while `Correctness` prevents concurrent processes from stepping on each others' toes and messing up the state of your system.
The author thinks that it's not necessary to use Redlock(running 5 redis servers and checking for a majority to acquire your lock). We can just use a single Redis instance with asynchronous replication to a secondary instance in case the primary crashes. It's ok to drop some locks occasionally as the  locks as an efficiency optimization. On the other hand, the Redlock algorithm cannot guarantee correctness for the reasons below. 

### Protecting a resource with a lock
In this part, the author gives an example to illustrate that even a resource is protected by a lock, it's still not safe in some cases, such as `stop-the-world GC pause`. If the GC lasts longer than the lease expiry period, the client doesn't realize that it has expired, it may go ahead and make some unsafe change. This kind of bug cannot be fix by inserting a check on the lock expiry just before writing back to storage as `GC can pause a running thread at any point, including the point that is maximally inconvenient for you(between the last check and the write operation)`.
Reasons why process might get paused:
  1. Stop-the-world GC pause may occur.
  2. Maybe your process tried to read an address that is not yet loaded into memory, so it gets a page fault and is paused until the page is loaded from disk.
  3. Maybe your disk is actually EBS, and so reading a variable unwittingly turned into a synchronous network request over Amazon’s congested network
  4. Maybe there are many other processes contending for CPU, and you hit a black node in your scheduler tree.
  5. Maybe someone accidentally sent SIGSTOP to the process. Whatever. Your processes will get paused.
  
To fix this problem, a fencing token should be used. A fencing token is a monotonously increasing number given to a client whenever it acquires the lock.
`Zookeeper` is a good lock service to do this: you can use `zxid` or the znode version number as fencing token. However, Redlock doesn't have a mechanism for generating fencing tokens.

### Using time to solve consensus
In this part, the author claims that the most practical system model for this kind of algorithm is the `asynchronous model with unreliable failure detectors`, which makes no assumptions about timing listed below but still do the right thing.
    1. processes may pause for arbitrary lengths of time. 
    2. packets may be arbitrarily delayed in the network. 
    3. clocks may be arbitrarily wrong.
    
Redlock is not safe as it depends on these timing assumptions: it assumes that all Redis node hold keys for the approximately the right length of time before expiring; that the network delay is small compared to the expiring duration; and that process pauses are much shorter than expiring duration.

### The synchrony assumptions of Redlock
Redlock is correct only if it's being used in a synchronous system model where you have known, fixed upper bound on network delay, pauses and clock drift.
Partially synchronous system means the timing assumptions will be satisfied most of the time and it can be achieved in a well-behaved datacenter environment. However, if you're dependent on Redlock for correctness, "most of the time" is not enough.
Actually, a consensus algorithm has a chance of working for a partially synchronous system model. Raft, Zeb and Paxos all fall in this category. These algorithms must hold no timing assumptions.

### Conclusion
Consensus algorithms should not make timing assumption as it violates safety properties if those assumptions are not met.
If you lock resources only for efficiency, the author recommends sticking with the `straightforward single-node locking algorithm` for Redis.
If you need correctness, don't use Redlock. Instead, use a proper consensus system such as ZooKeeper or use a database with reasonable transaction guarantees. Also, fencing tokens should be used on all resource accesses under the lock.
