# 2. Review
## [Microservice Architecture at Medium](https://medium.engineering/microservice-architecture-at-medium-9c33805eb74f)</br>
This ariticle talks about why and how Medium adopts microservice architecture from a monolithic architecture. 
Medium originally started with a monolithic Node.js app back in 2012. As the system becomes more complex and the team grows, Medium decided to move to a microservice architecture in early 2018. 

### What is Microservice Architecture?
In microservice architecture, microservices should follow these three principles: `single purpose`, `loosely coupled` and `high cohesion`.
  1. Single Purpose
    - Each service should focus on  one single purpose and do it well.
    - Without a single purpose, each microservice would end up doing too many things, growing as multiple "monolithic" services. We will not get the full benefits of the microservice architecture and we pay the operational cost.
     
  2. Loose Coupling
    - Services know little about each other. A change to one service should not require changing the others. 
    - Communication between services should happen only through public service interfaces.
    - Without loose coupling, changes to one service affect other services, so we would not be able to release changes fast and safely, `which is the core benefits of microservice architecture`. More importantly, issues caused by tight coupling could be disastrous, e.g., data inconsistencies or even data loss.
  3. High Cohesion
    - Each service encapsulates all related behaviors and data together. If we need to build a new feature, all the changes should be localized to just one single service.
    - Without high cohesion, we will end up with distributed monolithic system, which means changes and deployments should be made to a messy set of services at the same time in order to build a single feature. And that is even worse than a centralized monolithic system.
### Common Misunderstandings of Microservice Architecture
  1. A microservice is not a service that has a small number of lines of code or does "micro" tasks.
  2. A microservice is not a service that is built with new technology all the time. It's totally fine to build new services with the exact same technology stack, as long as the team benefits from decoupled services.
  3. A microservice is not a service that has to be built from scratch. There might be opportunities to extract the logic from the monolithic service directly.

### Why Now?
Always ask "Why now?" when migrating from monolithic architecture to microservice architecture. When you as "Why now?", you will think of the constraints -- impact to the current work, opportunity cost, overhead of distraction, etc. The reason why Medium adopt microservice now is that their Node.js monolithic app has become a bottleneck.

### Microservice Strategies
Adopting the microservice architecture in not easy and sometimes can go awry and actually hurt engineering productivity. In this section, seven strategies that help us in the early stage of adopting microservice architecture will be discussed. 
  1. Build new services with clear value
     New services should have either product value or engineering value. Otherwise, we should leave it in the monolithic app.
  2. Monolithic Persistent Storage Considered Harmful
     Sharing persistent data storage across services tend to be detrimental as violates loose coupling and high cohesion principles, and thus we should definitely avoid it at all cost.
     In microservice architecture, only one service should be responsible for a specific type of data. All the other services should be either request the data through the API or keep a read-only non-canonical(maybe matrialized) copy of the data.
  3. Decouple "Building a Service" and "Running a Service" 
     If building microservices is hard, then running services is often even harder. It slows down the developing speed when running services is coupled with building each service. The best practice is decoupling building services from implementing services.
  4. Thorough and Consistent Observability
     It's very important to have good and consistent observability from the beginning.
  5. Not Every New Service Needs to Be Built from Scratch
     If you are migrating from a monolithic service, you can just extract the logic from the monolithic app to build a microservice.
  6. Respect Failure Because They Will Happen
    - In a distributed environment, we should assume everything will fail at some point.
    - For RPC calls, put extra effort to handle failure cases.
    - Observability is important, make sure microservices are well monitored.
    - Always test failures when bringing a new service online. 
    - Build auto-recovery if possible.
  7. Avoid Microservice Syndromes from Day One
    - Poorly modeled microservices cause more harm than good.
    - Allowing too many different choices of languages/technology will increase the operational cost and fragment the engineering organization.
    - Coupling running services with building services can dramatically increases the complexity of each service and slow the team down.
    - Overlook data modeling and end up with microservices with monolithic data storage.
    - When facing a problem, teams tend to create a new service instead of fixing the existing one even though the latter may be a better choice.
    - Even though the services are loosely coupled, lack of holistic picture of the whole system could be problematic.
### Should We Stop Building Monolithic Services?
No. Even though microservice architecture is much better supported by new technolgies, it still involves a high level of complexity and complcation. For small teams, a monolithic app is still often a better option. However, do spend some time to architect the monolithic app in a way that is easier to migrate to a microservice architecture later when the system and the team grow.
