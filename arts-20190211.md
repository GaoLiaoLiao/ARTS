# 1. Algorithm
[995. Minimum Number of K Consecutive Bit Flips](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-124/problems/minimum-number-of-k-consecutive-bit-flips/)
```Java
思路：
    1. 从两边到中间，两边的数字只有一种flip方式，中间的数字可能从左边或右边flip。
        因此用贪心法从两边到中间的来flip

class Solution {
    // 思路：从两边到中间，两边已经flip成1的数字就不需要再flip一次了
    public int minKBitFlips(int[] A, int K) {
        int res = 0;
        int n = A.length;
        int left = -1;

## [How Do Annotations Work in Java?](https://dzone.com/articles/how-annotations-work-java)
This article talks about how annotations work in Java. Below are the tips I learned from this article.

1. Annotation is special kind of Java construct used to decorate and provide metadata for a `class`, `method`, `field`, `parameter`, `variable`, `constructor`, or `package`. Before annotation was introduced, XML were used for metadata, which is considered to be troublesome by many developers and architects. They wanted something coupled more closely with Java code and that's why annotations were introduced.

2. The syntax used to write annotation is like that of interface. Annotations are only metadata, and thus they do not contain any business logic. Standard annotations like `@Override` are consumed by JVM and it works at bytecode level. Developers can't control and can't use for custom annotations. </br>
  J2SE 5.0 provides four annotations that can be used when writing annotations, they are: `@Documented`, `@Retention`, `@Target` and `@Inherited`.
  
3. Annotations only support `primitives`, `string` and `enumerations`. All attributes of annotations are defined as methods and default values can be provided. If there is only one attribute, its name should be `value`.

4. we can use getAnnotation() method to get the annotation object of a Method object, a Class object or a Field object.

5. Annotations are very powerful and extensively used in frameworks like Spring and Hibernate for logging and validations.</br>
  Frameworks like Spring and Hibernate use AOP(aspect oriented programming), which provides mechanism to inject code for pre-precessing and post-processing. For example, you can have a hook to place code before and after a method execution, so you can write your consumer code in those places.

# 3. Tip
### [@classmethod vs @staticmethod](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12179271/meaning-of-classmethod-and-staticmethod-for-beginner/)
@classmethod means the method have access to the `class` itself (not an instance of the class but a class object). Thus, we can use @classmethod to create another "constructor".

@staticmethod is similar to @classmethod, but it doesn't take any obligatory parameters(like a class method or instance method does). We don't need to pass cls or self to static method.

```Python
class Date(object):
    def __init__(self, day=0, month=0, year=0):
        self.day = day
        self.month = month
        self.year = year

    def display(self):
        return "{0}-{1}-{2}".format(self.month, self.day, self.year)

    @staticmethod
    def millennium(month, day):
        return Date(month, day, 2000)


class DateTime(Date):
    def display(self):
        return "{0}-{1}-{2} - 00:00:00PM".format(self.month, self.day, self.year)

datetime1 = DateTime(10, 10, 1990)
datetime2 = DateTime.millennium(10, 10) # return a Date object!
print("datetime1:", type(datetime1)) # datetime1: <class '__main__.DateTime'>
print("datetime2:", type(datetime2)) # datetime2: <class '__main__.Date'>
```
change @staticmethod to @classmethod
```Python
class Date(object):
    def __init__(self, day=0, month=0, year=0):
        self.day = day
        self.month = month
        self.year = year

    def display(self):
        return "{0}-{1}-{2}".format(self.month, self.day, self.year)

    @classmethod
    def millennium(cls, month, day):
        return cls(month, day, 2000)


class DateTime(Date):
    def display(self):
        return "{0}-{1}-{2} - 00:00:00PM".format(self.month, self.day, self.year)

datetime1 = DateTime(10, 10, 1990)
datetime2 = DateTime.millennium(10, 10) # return a DateTime object!

print("datetime1:", type(datetime1)) # datetime1: <class '__main__.DateTime'>
print("datetime2:", type(datetime2)) # datetime2: <class '__main__.DateTime'>
```

### [Why does Java have transient fields?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/910374/why-does-java-have-transient-fields)
The `transient` keyword in Java is used to indicate that a field should not be part of the serialization process, which means the fields decorated by `transient` will not be serialized. At the time of deserialization, fields without transient will be restored while transient fields can not get their values before serialization.

## [Ten minutes a day](https://blog.usejournal.com/ten-minutes-a-day-e2fa1084f924)
This article talks about how the author spent ten minutes everyday and ultimately managed published his book Jumping into C++.
He mentioned three points that I would like to learn from:
  1. when you work on one thing everyday, the word becomes omnipresent. You may carry the puzzles to your commute or shower, which makes you think about the problems unconsciously.
  2. You can force yourself not to do other things before you finish today's task. In this way, you can create a habit loop.
  3. When you get stuck, work on something easy but related to your task. Also, you can go back over what was already achieved to inspire yourself.
