[995. Minimum Number of K Consecutive Bit Flips](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-124/problems/minimum-number-of-k-consecutive-bit-flips/)
```Java
思路：
    1. 从两边到中间，两边的数字只有一种flip方式，中间的数字可能从左边或右边flip。
        因此用贪心法从两边到中间的来flip

class Solution {
    // 思路：从两边到中间，两边已经flip成1的数字就不需要再flip一次了
    public int minKBitFlips(int[] A, int K) {
        int res = 0;
        int n = A.length;
        int left = -1;

## [How Do Annotations Work in Java?](https://dzone.com/articles/how-annotations-work-java)
Annotation is special kind of Java construct used to decorate a class, method, field, parameter, variable, constructor, or package. It’s the vehicle chosen by JSR-175 to provide metadata.

## [What is Netty?](http://ayedo.github.io/netty/2013/06/19/what-is-netty.html)
This article talks about what Netty is and explains some basic design philosophy Netty employed.

1. Netty is a networking library for Java: It was designed to support developers who wish to create applications such as web servers, chat servers, message brokers or whatever networking application you might come up with yourself.

2. Netty helps developers to deal with lower level networking I/O. Netty helps developers write and maintain asynchronous code.

3. With Netty, we could do I/O using a single thread or a small number of threads instead of creating a thread for each request, as threads are quite expensive in terms of memory consumption and context switch and multi-threaded programming is complicated.

4. Netty provides developers a unified asynchronous API abstraction over the native Java I/O frameworks, which means we can write applications against Netty API and specify which underlying native API we want to use. </br>
  Netty uses `selector` to pick available events for threads, developers only need to write the business code to deal with these events.

5. Netty uses `Reactor` pattern. If you would like react to an event, you can just subscribe a method to it. Once the event occurs, the dispatcher then calls the subscribed calls one by one. This pattern is commonly known as `the event loop` or `event dispatcher`. </br>
  Netty allows developers to attach a whole sequence of handlers to an event, which can pass their output as input to the next handler.

# 3. Tip
### [@classmethod vs @staticmethod](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12179271/meaning-of-classmethod-and-staticmethod-for-beginner/)
@classmethod means the method have access to the `class` itself (not an instance of the class but a class object). Thus, we can use @classmethod to create another "constructor".

@staticmethod is similar to @classmethod, but it doesn't take any obligatory parameters(like a class method or instance method does). We don't need to pass cls or self to static method.

```Python
class Date(object):
    def __init__(self, day=0, month=0, year=0):
        self.day = day
        self.month = month
        self.year = year

    def display(self):
        return "{0}-{1}-{2}".format(self.month, self.day, self.year)

    @staticmethod
    def millennium(month, day):
        return Date(month, day, 2000)


class DateTime(Date):
    def display(self):
        return "{0}-{1}-{2} - 00:00:00PM".format(self.month, self.day, self.year)

datetime1 = DateTime(10, 10, 1990)
datetime2 = DateTime.millennium(10, 10) # return a Date object!
print("datetime1:", type(datetime1)) # datetime1: <class '__main__.DateTime'>
print("datetime2:", type(datetime2)) # datetime2: <class '__main__.Date'>
```

```Python
class Date(object):
    def __init__(self, day=0, month=0, year=0):
        self.day = day
        self.month = month
        self.year = year

    def display(self):
        return "{0}-{1}-{2}".format(self.month, self.day, self.year)

    @classmethod
    def millennium(cls, month, day):
        return cls(month, day, 2000)


class DateTime(Date):
    def display(self):
        return "{0}-{1}-{2} - 00:00:00PM".format(self.month, self.day, self.year)

datetime1 = DateTime(10, 10, 1990)
datetime2 = DateTime.millennium(10, 10) # return a DateTime object!

print("datetime1:", type(datetime1)) # datetime1: <class '__main__.DateTime'>
print("datetime2:", type(datetime2)) # datetime2: <class '__main__.DateTime'>
```

## [How do you finish big side projects?](https://eccentric-j.com/blog/4-completing-side-projects-in-2019.html)
Many developers have their own side projects. Some developers create their own side projects for fun. Others work on their own side projects trying to earn more money. A big issue with all these projects is that a lot of side projects are not finished as expected. This articles talks about how to finish big side projects.
