[981. Time Based Key-Value Store](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-121/problems/time-based-key-value-store/)
```Java
思路：
    1. 利用一个Map<String, TreeMap<Integer, String>>来记录同一个key在不同时间的value是什么。
    
class TimeMap {
    Map<String, TreeMap<Integer, String>> map;
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public TimeMap() {
        map = new HashMap<>();
    }
    
    public void set(String key, String value, int timestamp) {
        if(!map.containsKey(key)) {
            map.put(key, new TreeMap<>());
        }
        map.get(key).put(timestamp, value);
    }
    
    public String get(String key, int timestamp) {
        if(!map.containsKey(key)) {
            return "";
        }
        TreeMap<Integer, String> tmap = map.get(key);
        Integer floorKey = tmap.floorKey(timestamp);
        return floorKey == null ? "" : tmap.get(floorKey);
    }
}

/**
 * Your TimeMap object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * TimeMap obj = new TimeMap();
 * obj.set(key,value,timestamp);
 * String param_2 = obj.get(key,timestamp);
 */

## [What is the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)?](https://realpython.com/python-gil/)
The Python Global Interpreter Lock(GIL) is a mutex(or a lock) that allows only one thread to hold the control of the Python interpreter. In other words, only one thread can be in state of execution at a time, even in multi-threaded architecture with more than one CPU core. And this feature has become a bottle for CPU-bound and multi-threaded programs.

### What problem did the GIL solve for Python?
Python uses reference counting to manage memory. The reference counts need to be protected from race conditions where multiple threads increase or decrease its value simultaneously. Without GIL, race conditions might cause memory leaks or, even worse, incorrectly release the memory while a reference to that object still exists. One solution is that we can add a lock to each object or groups of objects, but multiple locks mean another potential issue -- deadlocks. By adding only a lock to reference counts, Python can perfectly make these variables safe when shared across threads and avoid deadlocks.

### Why was the GIL chosen as the solution?
It seems that GIL is not a good solution as it decrease the performance of CPU-bound multi-threaded programs, so why was GIL introduced in the first place? There is a history reason behind it: When Python was created, a lot of extensions were being written for the existing C libraries whose feature were needed in Python. To prevent inconsistent changes, these C extensions required a thread-safe memory management which the GIL provided. The GIL is simple to implement and was easily added to Python. It provides a performance increase to single-threaded programs as only one lock needs to be managed.

### The impact on multi-threaded Python programs
There are two kinds of threads: CPU-bound thread and I/O-bound thread.
The GIL doesn't have much impact on the performance of I/O bound threads. However, GIL prevents CPU-bound threads from executing in parallel.

### Why hasn't the GIL been removed yet?
Removing GIL means incompatibility issues. Other solutions to the problems that the GIL solves might even decrease the performance of single-threaded programs and multi-threaded I/O-bound programs. Thus, removing the GIL is not an easy thing.

### How to deal with Python's GIL?
There are some approaches to the problems caused by GIL:
  1. multiprocessing library</br>
    The most popular way is to use a multi-processing approach where each process gets its own Python interpreter and memory space so that GIL won't be a problem.
  2. Alternative Python interpreter</br>
    There are some Python interpreters, such as Jython and IronPython, which don't have GIL.
  3. Just wait it out</br>
    Some developers in Python community are working on the removal of GIL from CPython. One such attempt is Gilectomy.

### [What does the number in parentheses shown after Unix command names in manpages mean?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62936/what-does-the-number-in-parentheses-shown-after-unix-command-names-in-manpages-m)
Recently I'm reading the book Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment and I found there are sometimes a number in parentheses after Unix command names in the book, like max(1), find(3). After reading [this page]((https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62936/what-does-the-number-in-parentheses-shown-after-unix-command-names-in-manpages-m)), I found the numbers have different meanings:
  1. General commands
  2. System calls
  3. C library functions
  4. Special files(usually devices that can be found in /dev) and drivers
  5. File formats and conventions
  6. Games and screensavers
  7. Miscellanea
  8. System administration commands and daemons

### [The Law of Leaky Abstractions](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/)</br>
This article talks about an issue called `the Law of Leaky Abstractions`:
```
All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.
```
To explain that, the author starts with the example of TCP protocol and IP protocol.
    1. TCP protocol - reliable
    2. IP protocol - unreliable
    3. TCP is built on top of IP.

the TCP protocol is an abstraction of IP. It is a simplification of IP protocol, which is much more complicated and going on under the cover. TCP attempts to provide a complete abstraction of an underlying unreliable network, but sometimes the network leaks through the abstraction(eg. network cable cut off),and you feel the things that the abstraction can't guarantee what they are supposed to guarantee.

The author thinks leaky abstraction is problematic as abstractions don't simplify our lives as much as they were meant to. Developers still have to learn what's going on under the hood. besides that, the author mentions that now developers have to learn not only high level programing tools with better abstractions, but low level knowledge of the abstractions. Thus, the author says that The Law of Leaky Abstraction is dragging us down.

From my point of view, we could say that The Law of Leaky Abstraction is dragging us down, but we could also view it as encouragement for us to learn the low level knowledge of the convenient abstractions we take for granted everyday.
