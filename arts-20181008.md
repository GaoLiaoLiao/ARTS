#### The Meaning of ACID
This week I read chapter 7 of the book 'Design Data-intensive Applications' and got to learn the meaning of ACID, which I misunderstood for a long time.
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability.
  - Atomicity
    - atomic refers to something that cannot be broken down into smaller parts. The word means differently in different branches of computing. 
      - In multi-threaded programming, if one thread executes an atomic operation, that means there is no way another could see the half-finished result of the operation.
      - In the context of ACID, atomicity is not about concurrency. It doesn't describe what happens if several processes try to access the same data at the same time, because that is covered under the letter I, for Isolation.
      - Atomicity, in the context of ACID, actually means what happens if a client wants to make several writes, but a fault occurs after some of the writes have been processed. If the writes are grouped together into an atomic transaction, and the transaction cannot be completed(committed) due to a fault, then the transaction is aborted and the database must discard or undo any writes it has made so far in that transaction. 
    - Atomicity simplifies a problem: if a transaction was aborted, the application can be sure that it didn't change anything, so it can safely be retried.
  - Consistency
    - The word Consistency is overladed and it has at least four meanings and is being used in many cases.
      - Replica consistency, eventual consistency
      - Consistent hashing
      - In the context of CAP theorem, consistency means linearizability.
      - In the context of ACID, consistency refers to an application-specific notion of the database being in a "good state".
    - The idea of ACID consistency is that you have certain statements about your data(invariants) that must always be true. For example, in an accounting system, credits and debits across all accounts must be balanced. If a transaction starts with a database that is valid according to these invariants, and any writes during the transaction preserve the validity, then you can be sure that the invariants are always satisfied.
    - However, consistency depends on the application's notion of invariants, and it's the application's responsibility to define its transactions correctly so that they preserve consistency. 
    - Atomicity, Isolation, and Durability are properties s of the database, whereas Consistency is a property of the application. The application may reply on the database's atomicity and isolation properties in order to achieve consistency, but it's not up to the database alone. Thus, the letter C doesn't really belong in ACID.
  - Isolation
    - Isolation in the sense of ACID means that concurrently executing transactions are isolated from each other: they cannot step on each other's toes.
    - The classic database textbooks formalized isolation as 'serializability', which means that each transaction can pretend that it is the only transaction running on the entire database. The database ensure that when the transactions have committed, the result is the same as if they had run serially, even though in reality they may have run concurrently.
    - However, in practice, serializable isolation is rarely used because of the performance penalty it carries. Instead, snapshot isolation, which is weaker gurantee than serializability, is implemented by tech companies, such as Oracle.
  - Durability
    - Durability is the promise that once a transaction has committed successfully, any data it has written will not be forgotten, even if there is a hardware fault or the database crashes.
    - In practice, tehre is no technique that can provide absolute guarantees.Thre are only various risk-reducing techniques including writing to disk, replicating to remote machines, and backups - and they can and should be used together.
