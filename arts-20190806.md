Recently, I'm learning a React course online and found it quit strange that I need to bind event handlers to `this` manually. I got to know why we need to bind event handlers in Class Components in React in [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/this-is-why-we-need-to-bind-event-handlers-in-class-components-in-react-f7ea1a6f93eb/).

  1. IntelliJ的debug模式下Evalute Expression     
  2. 学习了React生命周期函数
  3. 使用Charles模拟服务器数据

### [THE PMARCA GUIDE TO STARTUPS - Part 4: The only thing that matters](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html)
This article is the fourth part of Marc Andreessen's advice to startups, which was originally published in [his blog](blog.pmarca.com).

In this article, Marc argues that markets are the most important thing for startups. He explains that a good team or a good product matters less than a good market does by answering the three questions:
  1. What does a great team actually get you?
  2. Can't great products sometimes create huge new markets?
  3. As a startup founder, what should I do about all this?
  
For the third question, Marc introduced a term, the `product/market fit`, which means `Being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market`. </br>
When you are BPMF(before product/market fit), focus obsessively on getting to product/market fit, do whatever is required to get to product/market fit.
