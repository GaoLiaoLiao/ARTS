    ListNode pre = null;
    
    public void reorderList(ListNode head) {
        if(head == null) {
            return;
        }
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;
        
        // find the middle of the list
        while(fast.next != null && fast.next.next != null) {
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;
        }
        
        
        fast = slow.next;
        slow.next = null; // split the list
        slow = head;
        
        // Reverse the second half
        fast = reverse(fast);

### 2. Review
#### What is Apache Kafka?
Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform.
  - Why use Apache Kafka?
    - Its abstraction is a queue and it features:
      - a distributed pub-sub messaging system. Publishers and Subscribers can operate at their own rates.
      - super fast with `zero-copy` technology
      - support fault-tolerant data persistence
    - It can be applied to 
      - logging by topics
      - messaging system
      - geo-replication
      - stream processing
  - Why is Kafka so fast?
    - Kafka is using zero copy in which that CPU does not perform the task of copying data from one memory area to another.
  - Architecture
    - For producers and consumers, kafka is abstracted as brokers, where producers write message to and consumers read message from.
    - Topic
      - Data is stored in topics and split into partitions which are replicated.
      - A topic is a category to which records are published. 
      - Topics in Kafka are always multi-subscriber; that is, a topic can have zero, one, or more consumers that subscribe to data written to it.
      - For each topic, the Kafka cluster maintains a partitioned log, which consists of some partitions. The records in the partitions are each assigned a sequential id number called the `offset` that uniquely identifies each record within the partition.
      - Kafka stores all published records - whether or not they have been consumed - using a configurable retention policy. 
      - Kafka's performance is effectively constant with respect to data size so storing data for a long time is not a problem.
      - The partitions in the log serve several purposes.
        - First, they allow the log to scale beyond a size that will fit on a single server. Each individual partition must fit on the servers that host it, but a topic may have many partitions so it can handle an arbitrary amount of data.
        - Second, they act as the unit of parallelism - more on that in a bit.
    - Distribution
      - The partitions of the log are distributed over the servers in the Kafka cluster with each server handling data and requests for a share of the partitions. Each partition is replicated across a configurable number of servers for fault tolerance.
      - Each partition has one server which acts as the "leader" and zero or more servers which act as "followers". The leader handles all read and write requests for the partition while the followers passively replicate the leader. If the leader fails, one of the followers will automatically become the new leader. Each server acts as a leader for some of its partitions and a follower for others so load is well balanced within the cluster.
    - Producers
      - Producers publish data to the topics of their choice. The producer is responsible for choosing which record to assign to which partition within the topic. This can be done in a round-robin fashion simply to balance load or it can be done according to some semantic partition function(say based on some key in the record). More on the use of partitioning in a second.
    - Consumers
      - Consumers label themselves with a consumer group name, and each record published to a topic is delivered to one consumer instance within each subscribing consumer group. 
      - Consumer instance can be in separate processes or on separate machines.
      - If all the consumer instances have the same consumer group, then the records will effectively be load balanced over the consumer instances.
      - If all the consumer instances have differentconsumer groups, then each record will be broadcast to all the consumer processes.
    - Brokers, producers, consumers use `ZooKeeper` to manage and share state.
    - Producer publishes messages to a specific topic.
      - Write to in-memory buffer first and then flush to disk.
      - append-only sequential writing for fast write.
      - Available to read after writing to disks.
    - Consumers pulls messages from a specific topic.
      - use an "offset pointer" to track its only read progress.
    - How to serialize data? Avro.
    - What is its network protocol? TCP.
    - How to tolerate fault? ISR protocol.

### 3. Tip
This week, I learned some knowledge of Java Concurrency from [this link](https://blog.csdn.net/xiaokang123456kao/article/details/77331878).
This article demonstrated three ways for three threads to print string alternatively.
  1. ReentrantLock
  2. ReentrantLock + Condition
  3. Semaphore

#### [Search company Elastic nearly doubles on first trading day](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/elastic-estc-ipo-stock-makes-debut-on-nyse.html)<br/>
  Elastic, a company famous for its commercializeds open-source software `Elastic Search`, nearly doubles on first trading day. The performace is better than that of some other tech companies in 2018 sucha as Dropbox and DocuSign.
