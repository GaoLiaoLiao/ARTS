# 1. Algorithm
[962. Maximum Width Ramp](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-width-ramp/)
```Java
思路：
    1. 根据数组A做一个index list，把index list按照A[index]的从小到大排序。
        遍历index list，每次遇到一个index，这个index对应的值A[index]都大于等于index list里之前的index_pre对应的A[index_pre]
        index - min(index_pre)的最大值即是我们要求的结果！要快速求出min(index_pre)，需要在每次迭代中更新minIndex的值
    2. 本方法的时间复杂度是O(nlogn)，因为排序了

class Solution {
    public int maxWidthRamp(int[] A) {
        if(A == null || A.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        int n = A.length;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            list.add(i);
        }
        // 如果两个下标对应的元素值相等，那么较小的下标排在前面
        Collections.sort(list, (a, b) -> {
            if(A[a] == A[b]) {
                return a - b;
            }
            return A[a] - A[b];
        });
        
        // 我觉得下面这句有问题，但是leetcode所有test case能通过。
        // Collections.sort(list, (a, b) -> A[a] - A[b]);
        
        // res初始值是0，list.get(i) - minIndex的值有可能是负数。
        int res = 0;
        int minIndex = list.get(0);
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            res = Math.max(res, list.get(i) - minIndex);
            minIndex = Math.min(minIndex, list.get(i));
        }
        return res;
    }
}

思路：
    1. 找出decreasing sequence，可以把原数组A看成是一个降序序列（肯定包含第一个元素），只不过降序序列相邻的两个数字中间查了若干非降序的数字
        比如：[5,7,9,3,4,2,3]，降序序列是[5,3,2]，[5,3]之间插入了7和9，[3,2]之间插入了4，[2]后面插入了3
        把降序序列的下标存入到Stack里，然后从后往前遍历数组A，求出maxium width ramp
        比如[5,7,9,3,4,2,3]这个最大的ramp是数字5和数字9的下标差，数字9把stack里数字5的下标0消耗掉了，因此在遍历到数字7的时候，stack其实已经是空的了，但是这不影响结果！因为ramp(5,7) = 1 < ramp(5,9) = 2
        参考了这个链接：【https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-width-ramp/discuss/208348/JavaC++Python-O(N)-Using-Stack】
        

class Solution {
    public int maxWidthRamp(int[] A) {
        Stack<Integer> stk = new Stack<>();
        
        int n = A.length;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if(stk.isEmpty() || A[i] < A[stk.peek()]) {
                stk.push(i);
            }
        }
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            while(!stk.isEmpty() && stk.peek() <= i && A[stk.peek()] <= A[i]) {
                res = Math.max(res, i - stk.pop());
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

## Four Types of References in Java
There four types of references in Java. They are:
  1. Strong reference
  2. Weak reference
  3. Soft reference
  4. Phantom Reference

### Strong Reference
Strong references are used everywhere: we can create and object and then assign it to a reference. If an object has a strong reference, this object will never be garbage-collected.

### Soft Reference
Soft reference objects are cleared when there isn't enough memory. All soft references to softly reachable objects are guaranteed to have been cleared before the JVM throws an `OutOfMemoryError`.</br>
Soft references are mostly used to implement memory-sensitive caches as soft references can be used to implement a cache that can grow without risking an application crash. To do this, you need to implement a Map interface in which values are stored, wrapped inside a soft reference. Soft references will keep
the object alive as long as there is enough memory available on the heap, but it will discard them before an `OutOfMemoryError`.

### Weak Reference
Weak reference objects don't prevent their referents from being garbage-collected. </br>
Weak References can be used to store some information related to an object until the object gets finalized. To do this, you can implement a Map in which keys are wrapped in a weak reference. As soon as GC reclaims the key object, you can remove the values as well. Using GC to do reclaim the key objects is more robust and efficient. WeakHashMap in java.util is a good example to learn weak references.

### Phantom Reference
An object is phantom reachable if it is neither strongly nor softly nor weakly reachable and has been finalized and there is a path from roots to it that contains at least one phantom reference. If the GC determines that the referent of a phantom reference is phantom reachable, then the phantom reference will be added to the reference queue that the reference is registered with. You can then retrieve the phantom reference by using remove() methods of the reference queue class.</br>
Phantom reference is different from strong, soft and weak references, as it isn't meant to be used to access the object, but as a signal that the object has already been finalized and the GC is ready to reclaim its memory. </br>
Phantom references have two major differences from soft and weak references:
  1. We can't get referent of a phantom reference. The referent is never accessible directly through the API and this is why we need a reference queue to work with phantom references. 
  2. The GC adds a phantom reference to a reference queue after the finalize method of its referent is executed. It implies that the instance is still in the memory. An object that is reachable via phantom references will remain so until all such references are cleared or themselves become unreachable. In other words, we mush call remove() method of ReferenceQueue class or allow the phantom references themselves to be garbage-collected if we want to an object to be garbage-collected.
  
Using phantom references is a safe way to know an object has been removed from memory. For instance, consider an application that deals with large images. We won't load a new image until the old image is collected. The reference of the old image will be enqueued in the reference queue once the old image object is finalized. After receiving that reference, we can load the new image into memory.
<!-- 这句什么意思？Similarly we can use Phantom References to implement a Connection Pool. We can easily gain control over the number of open connections, and can block until one becomes available.  -->
  
<!--Phantom references can be used to notify you when some object is out of scope to do some resource cleanup. Recall that object.finalize() method is not guaranteed to be called at the end of the life of an object, so if you need to close files or free resources, you can rely on Phantom. Since Phantom doesn't have a link to the actual object, a typical pattern is to derive your own reference type from phantom and add some info useful for the final freeing, for example filename.-->

### [Freedom:How to quit your job](https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Skills-software-developers-manual/dp/1617292397)</br>
This week, I read an article in the book *Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual*. In this article, the author gives some practical advice on how to quick your current job and start to work for yourself.
1. The author thinks it's not advisable to quit your job without a plan. You should figure out how to start building up your new business on the side and make it successful enough to support you while you make the transition.
  - By starting your business on the side while you still have your fulltime job, you will get an idea of what it feels like to work longer days and to run the new venture.  
  - One's first business is likely to fail. It might take you more than a few tries to create a successful business that can sustain you. If you fail at your business, you'll still have the income from your job to rely on.
2. The author felt surprised that he didn't actually really work 8 hours per day on productive work because of emails, meetings and even facebook and laziness. With that being said, the actually means:
  - You will be working much harder than you do working for someone else, so you should be prepared for the workload. 
  - It's important to realize that you can't necessarily plan eight hours' worth of work into your working day when you work for yourself.Before you quit your job, you should have realistic expectation of how much work you actually get done and to train yourself ahead of time to handle a much heavier workload.
3. The author also mentions that we should be aware of dangerous employment contracts. We should know how to handle employment contracts which claim that the company owns what you produced.
  - If the contracts claims that everything you create belongs to your company whether you do it on your own time or not, maybe you should quit this job.
  - If the contracts says that what you create on company time or using company resources belongs to them, you should carefully document the hours you worked on your side project and the resources you that were used. Maybe consulting a lawyer is a good choice.

4. The author also advices that we should take the following two actions:
  - Calculate exactly how much money you'll need to earn each month to live. You'll need to figure out a way to reduce the amount so that your side business will need to bring in less income.
  - Start tracking your time every day at work. Get an idea of how you're spending your time currently each day and figure out how much of that time is actually productive time. You might be surprised by the results.
