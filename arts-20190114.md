[974. Subarray Sums Divisible by K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sums-divisible-by-k/description/)
```Java
思路：
974. Subarray Sums Divisible by K【Contest 119】
    1. 类似【325. Maximum Size Subarray Sum Equals k】
        唯一不同的是本题把mod作为key
    2. 负数的mod是可能是负数！因此需要把负数mod转成正数！
        A % B的含义其实是A除以B的余数。
        如果A%B == 3, 说明多出3个！
        如果A%B == -1，说明多出-1个，也就是A说少了1个，（A+1）% B == 0。反过来想，其实是多了B-1个！因此用-1加上B，即是通过转化得到的“正模”。
        举个具体例子：-1 % 5 
        -1 % 5 == -1，即-1少了1个才能正好整除5， 即-1 + 1 = 0， 0可以正好整除5。 但是-1也可以通过 -1 - 4 = -5，-5也可以正好整除5。
        因此-1的“负模”是-1，即-1比刚好可以整除5的临近数字（即0）少了1。
        因此-1的“正模”是4，即-1比刚好可以整除5的临近数字（即-5）多出4。
        
class Solution {
    public int subarraysDivByK(int[] A, int K) {
        int res = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int sum = 0;
        map.put(0, 1);
        
        for(int num : A) {
            sum += num;
            int remainder = sum % K;
            // 记得要加下面这句，因为负数的mod是负数，因此需要手动把remainder变成正数
            if(remainder < 0) {
                remainder += K;
            }
            if(!map.containsKey(remainder)) {
                map.put(remainder, 1);
            } else {
                res += map.get(remainder);
                map.put(remainder, map.get(remainder) + 1);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}

## [Speed Up Your Python Program With Concurrency](https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/#how-to-speed-up-an-io-bound-program)
This article talks about three ways to speed up python programs. They are:
  - threading
  - asyncio
  - multiprocessing
  
threading and asyncio both run on a single processor, while multiprocessing can utilize multiple processor at literally the same time.

### What is Concurrency?
threading uses `pre-emptive multitasking`, which means the operating system knows about each thread and can interrupt it at any time to start running a different thread. 

asyncio, on the other hand, uses `cooperative multitasking`, and that means task must cooperate by announcing when they are ready to be switched out, and thus means extra code. The general concept of asyncio is that a single python object, called event loop, controls how and when each task gets run.

### What is Parallelism?
With multiprocessing, python creates new processes. Each process can be thought of as almost a completely different program. Technically, the processes are usually defined as a collection of resources where the resources include memory, file handlers and thing like that. One way to think about it is process runs in its own python interpreter. Different processes can run on different CPUs in parallel, and that's how multiprocessing speeds up programs.

### When is Concurreny Useful?
There are two kinds of problems:
1. I/O-bound problem</br>
  I/O-bound problems cause your program to slow down as CPU spend most of the time waiting for input/output from some external resources, like network or file system. Generally, I/O-bound problems arise frequently when your program is working with things that are much slower than your CPU.

2. CPU-bound problem</br>
  The resource that limits CPU-bound programs is CPU, instead of network or file systems. 

### How to Speed Up an I/O-Bound Program
In this part, the article compares `Synchronous Version`, `threading Version`, `asyncio Version` and `multiprocessing Version`. We can see from the result of the codes that, threading, asyncio and multiprocessing can all improve the performance of the original synchronous code.

### How to Speed up a CPU-Bound Program
In this part, the article mentions that the `threading Version` and `asyncio Version` do not improve the performance of CPU-bound programs, and even make them slower as they need to do extra work of setting up threads and tasks. Only the `multiprocessing Version` helps speed up CPU-bound programs.

### When to use Concurrency?
Hold back on adding concurrency until there is a performance issue and then determine which type of concurrency you need. As Donald Knuth said, "Premature optimization is the root of all evil(or at least most of it) in programming."
  - If your program is I/O-bound program, there's a general rule of thumb in Python community, "Use asyncio when you can, threading when you must". However, sometimes you will require libraries that haven't been ported to take advantage of asyncio. Any task that doesn't give up control to the event loop will block all of the other tasks.
  - If your program is CPU-bound program, use multiprocessing. threading and asyncio wouldn't help.

# 3. Tip
## Python Context Manager
The with statement helps avoid bugs and leaks by releasing a resource automatically. </br>
To support with statement, a class should implement `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. </br>
Python will call these two methods at the appropriate time in the resource management cycle. </br>
Python calls __enter__ when execution enters the context of the with statement and it's time to acquire the resource. </br>
When execution leaves the context, python calls __exit__ to release the resource. </br>

```Python
# BAD
# The three lines of code below doesn't guarantee the file is closed 
# if there's an exception during the f.write() call -- and therefore our program might leak a file descriptor.
f = open('hello.txt', 'w')
f.write('hello, world') 
f.close()

# UGLY
#f = open('hello.txt', 'w')
#try:
#    f.write('hello, world')
#finally:
#    f.close()

# GOOD
with open('file.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('hello world')
    

# UGLY
#some_lock = threading.Lock()
#some_lock.acquire()
#try:
#    # do something
#finally:
#    some_lock.release()

# GOOD
some_lock = threading.Lock()
with some_lock:
    # do something
    
# self-defined context manager
class ManagedFile:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __enter__(self):
        self.file = open(self.name, 'w')
        return self.file

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        if self.file:
            self.file.close()
                
with ManagedFile('hello.txt') as f:
    f.write('hello, world!')
    f.write('bye now')
    
# use contextlib.contextmanager decorator to support context manager
# In this case, managed_file() is a generator that first acquires the resource. 
# Then it temporarily suspends its own execution and yields the resource so it can be used by the caller. 
# When the caller leaves the with context, the generator continues to execute 
# so that any remaining clean up steps can happen and the resource gets released back to the system.

from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def managed_file(name):
    try:
        f = open(name, 'w')
        yield f
    finally:
        f.close()

with managed_file('hello.txt') as f:
    f.write('hello, world!')
    f.write('bye now')
```

### [如何成为一个大家愿意追随的Leader？](https://time.geekbang.org/column/article/297)</br>
本周读了耗叔专栏里的这篇文章。文章里讲了两点: 
1. Leader和Boss的不同</br>
  Boss的领导力则来自于职位和震慑, Leader的领导力来自于大家自发的跟随；</br>
  Boss驱动员工, Leader指导员工；</br>
  Boss制造畏惧, Leader制造热情；</br>
  Boss在面对错误的时候喜欢使用人士惩罚手段,Leader在面对错误的时候喜欢寻找解决问题的技术和管理方法；</br>
  Boss只知道怎么做, Leader展示怎么做；</br>
  Boss用人, Leader发展人；</br>
  Boss从团队收割成绩, Leader给予团队成绩；</br>
  Boss喜欢命令和控制, Leader喜欢沟通和协作；</br>
  Boss喜欢说“给我上”, Leader喜欢说“跟我上”。
    
2. 如何成为Leader</br>
  技术领导力可以让我们具有帮助他人解决问题的能力，从而受到他人的依赖。除了技术领导力，leader需要赢得他人的信任； 需要有开放的心态 + 倾向性的价值观； 需要lead by example； 需要保持热情和冲劲； 需要抓重点，看透本质； 需要描绘令人激动的方向，提供令人向往的环境； 需要甘当铺路石，为他人创造机会。
