[974. Subarray Sums Divisible by K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sums-divisible-by-k/description/)
```Java
思路：
974. Subarray Sums Divisible by K【Contest 119】
    1. 类似【325. Maximum Size Subarray Sum Equals k】
        唯一不同的是本题把mod作为key
    2. 负数的mod是可能是负数！因此需要把负数mod转成正数！
        A % B的含义其实是A除以B的余数。
        如果A%B == 3, 说明多出3个！
        如果A%B == -1，说明多出-1个，也就是A说少了1个，（A+1）% B == 0。反过来想，其实是多了B-1个！因此用-1加上B，即是通过转化得到的“正模”。
        举个具体例子：-1 % 5 
        -1 % 5 == -1，即-1少了1个才能正好整除5， 即-1 + 1 = 0， 0可以正好整除5。 但是-1也可以通过 -1 - 4 = -5，-5也可以正好整除5。
        因此-1的“负模”是-1，即-1比刚好可以整除5的临近数字（即0）少了1。
        因此-1的“正模”是4，即-1比刚好可以整除5的临近数字（即-5）多出4。
        
class Solution {
    public int subarraysDivByK(int[] A, int K) {
        int res = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int sum = 0;
        map.put(0, 1);
        
        for(int num : A) {
            sum += num;
            int remainder = sum % K;
            // 记得要加下面这句，因为负数的mod是负数，因此需要手动把remainder变成正数
            if(remainder < 0) {
                remainder += K;
            }
            if(!map.containsKey(remainder)) {
                map.put(remainder, 1);
            } else {
                res += map.get(remainder);
                map.put(remainder, map.get(remainder) + 1);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}

## [Speed Up Your Python Program With Concurrency](https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/#how-to-speed-up-an-io-bound-program)
This article talks about three ways to speed up python programs. They are:
  - threading
  - asyncio
  - multiprocessing
threading and asyncio both run on a single processor, while multiprocessing can utilize multiple processor at literally the same time.
### What is Concurrency?
threading use `pre-emptive multitasking`, which means the operating system knows about each thread and can interrupt it at any time to start running a different thread. 

asyncio, on the other hand, uses `cooperative multitasking`, and that means task must cooperate by announcing when they are ready to be switched out, and thus also means we need to write extra code to take care of it. The general concept of asyncio is that a single python object, called event loop, controls how and when each task gets run.

### What is Parallelism?
With multiprocessing, python creates new processes. Each process can be thought of as almost a completely different program. Technically, the processes are usually defined as a collection of resources where the resources include memory, file handlers and thing like that. One way to think about it is process runs in its own python interpreter. Different processes can run on different CPUs in parallel, and that's how multiprocessing speeds up programs.

### When is Concurreny Useful?
There are two kinds of problems:
1. I/O-bound problem
  I/O-bound problems cause your program to slow down as CPU spend most of the time waiting for input/output from some external resources, like network or file system. Generally, I/O-bound problems arise frequently when your program is working with things that are much slower than your CPU.

2. CPU-bound problem
  The resource that limits CPU-bound programs is CPU, instead of network or file systems. 

### How to Speed Up an I/O-Bound Program
In this part, the article compares `Synchronous Version`, `threading Version`, `asyncio Version` and `multiprocessing Version`. We can see from the result of the codes that, threading, asyncio and multiprocessing can all improve the performance of the original synchronous code.

### How to Speed up a CPU-Bound Program
In this part, the article mentions that the `threading Version` and `asyncio Version` do not improve the performance of CPU-bound programs, and even make them slower as they need to do extra work of setting up threads and tasks. Only the `multiprocessing Version` helps speed up CPU-bound programs.

### When to use Concurrency?
Hold back on adding concurrency until there is a performance issue and then determine which type of concurrency you need. As Donald Knuth said, "Premature optimization is the root of all evil(or at least most of it) in programming."
  - If your program is I/O-bound program, there's a general rule of thumb in Python community, "Use asyncio when you can, threading when you must". However, sometimes you will require libraries that haven't been ported to take advantage of asyncio. Any task that doesn't give up control to the event loop will block all of the other tasks.
  - If your program is CPU-bound program, use multiprocessing. threading and asyncio wouldn't help.

# 3. Tip
## Python Context Manager
The with statement helps avoid bugs and leaks by releasing a resource automatically.
To support with statement, a class should implement `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. Python will call these two methods at the appropriate time in the resource management cycle.
Python calls __enter__ when execution enters the context of the with statement and it's time to acquire the resource. When execution leaves the context, python calls __exit__ to release the resource.

```Python
# BAD
# The three lines of code below doesn't guarantee the file is closed if there's an exception during the f.write() call -- and therefore our program might leak a file descriptor.
f = open('hello.txt', 'w')
f.write('hello, world') 
f.close()

# UGLY
#f = open('hello.txt', 'w')
#try:
#    f.write('hello, world')
#finally:
#    f.close()

# GOOD
with open('file.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('hello world')
    

# UGLY
#some_lock = threading.Lock()
#some_lock.acquire()
#try:
#    # do something
#finally:
#    some_lock.release()

# GOOD
some_lock = threading.Lock()
with some_lock:
    # do something
    
# self-defined context manager
class ManagedFile:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __enter__(self):
        self.file = open(self.name, 'w')
        return self.file

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        if self.file:
            self.file.close()
                
with ManagedFile('hello.txt') as f:
    f.write('hello, world!')
    f.write('bye now')
    
# use contextlib.contextmanager decorator to support context manager
# In this case, managed_file() is a generator that first acquires the resource. Then it temporarily suspends its own execution and yields the resource so it can be used by the caller. When the caller leaves the with context, the generator continues to execute so that any remaining clean up steps can happen and the resource gets released back to the system.
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def managed_file(name):
    try:
        f = open(name, 'w')
        yield f
    finally:
        f.close()

with managed_file('hello.txt') as f:
    f.write('hello, world!')
    f.write('bye now')
```

### [如何成为一个大家愿意追随的Leader？](https://time.geekbang.org/column/article/297)</br>
This week, I read an article in the book *Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual*. In this article, the author gives some practical advice on how to quick your current job and start to work for yourself.
1. The author thinks it's not advisable to quit your job without a plan. You should figure out how to start building up your new business on the side and make it successful enough to support you while you make the transition.
    - By starting your business on the side while you still have your fulltime job, you will get an idea of what it feels like to work longer days and to run the new venture.  
    - One's first business is likely to fail. It might take you more than a few tries to create a successful business that can sustain you. If you fail at your business, you'll still have the income from your job to rely on.
2. The author felt surprised that he didn't actually really work 8 hours per day on productive work because of emails, meetings and even facebook and laziness. With that being said, the actually means:
    - You will be working much harder than you do working for someone else, so you should be prepared for the workload. 
    - It's important to realize that you can't necessarily plan eight hours' worth of work into your working day when you work for yourself.Before you quit your job, you should have realistic expectation of how much work you actually get done and to train yourself ahead of time to handle a much heavier workload.
3. The author also mentions that we should be aware of dangerous employment contracts. We should know how to handle employment contracts which claim that the company owns what you produced.
    - If the contract claims that everything you create belongs to your company whether you do it on your own time or not, maybe you should quit this job.
    - If the contract says that what you create on company time or using company resources belongs to them, you should carefully document the hours you worked on your side project and the resources you that were used. Maybe consulting a lawyer is a good choice.

4. The author also advices that we should take the following two actions:
    - Calculate exactly how much money you'll need to earn each month to live. You'll need to figure out a way to reduce the amount so that your side business will need to bring in less income.
    - Start tracking your time every day at work. Get an idea of how you're spending your time currently each day and figure out how much of that time is actually productive time. You might be surprised by the results.
